# ðŸŽ¯ Hand Tracking & Volume Control

ðŸš€ A Python-based real-time **hand tracking** system that controls system volume using finger gestures.  
This project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Pycaw** to track hand movements and adjust volume intuitively.

---

## âœ¨ Features  
âœ… **Hand Detection** using MediaPipe  
âœ… **Volume Control** based on finger distance  
âœ… **Lock Gesture** (fist) to prevent accidental volume changes  
âœ… **Real-time Performance** with FPS display  

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements  
Make sure you have **Python 3.12 or lower** installed, as **MediaPipe does not support Python 3.13**.

### Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw comtypes
